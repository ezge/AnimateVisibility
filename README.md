The Compose Animation API animates the appearance and
disappearance of components within a user interface
layout. This requires the use of the animatedVisibility()
function which may be configured to use different
animation effects and durations, both for the appearance
and disappearance of the target composable. The
Animation API also includes crossfade support which allows
the replacement of one component with another to be
animated.
